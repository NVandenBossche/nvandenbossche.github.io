If you haven't listened yet to the TalentHub podcast, this is the right time to start. I've been listening to it for quite a while and learned so much about different people in the Salesforce ecosystem.

Needless to say it was an honour for me to be one of Ben's guests, and it was a really fun experience. Hope you'll have as much fun listening to it, and make sure to catch some of the other great episodes as well!
