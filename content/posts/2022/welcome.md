Welcome to my personal website and blog.

You might be wondering what's in the image on top of this post. It's the opening scene from one of my favourite video games: Final Fantasy X. So why this game? Apart from the amazing fantasy world it brought to life in my teenage mind, it was the first game that truly captured my love for bringing structure to complex environments through it's [Sphere Grid](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Sphere_Grid).

Many years later I'm still bringing structure to the complexities of daily life, be it on a professional level with customers or on a personal level with my loved ones. You could say that the Sphere Grid helped shape my analytical mind.

Hopefully you'll enjoy reading the ramblings of this analytical mind across the different blog posts on this website.

### Goals

The first goal for creating this website is to give myself a form of motivation to expand my horizons by writing about personal projects inside my areas of interest. The second goal is to share the knowledge gained during those projects with others, with you.

### How this came to be

I've been playing with the idea of creating this space for a while, but never prioritized it until now. Actually, I registered the domain name back in February 2021 and it just laid dormant for months.

In the end it took me less than 10 hours to put a very good first version together. It's a good reminder that sometimes you need to take a step back and focus on what's really important - spoiler: watching series isn't :wink:.

### Content to expect

So, what can you expect to find here in the future? The type of content will be mainly Salesforce-related, but sometimes I might post about different technologies or interests. Some examples:

-   Salesforce Identity & Access Management
    > I'm weird and find OAuth flows super interesting. I love diving into complex setups with different actors to get to an ideal solution.
-   Salesforce DevOps
    > There's still a huge potential here in the Salesforce space. We're still catching up on what's possible with DevOps in traditional software development, but quickly closing that gap.
-   Salesforce Software Engineering
    > The proprietary technologies running on Salesforce (Apex, VF, Aura, LWC) are relatively easy to pick up by someone who doesn't have a software engineering background. I'm very interested in how we can bring more software engineering skills inside the ecosystem to ensure that everything customized on the platform remains scalable.
-   Creation & maintenance of this website using Hugo
    > I've picked up this new framework called Hugo to build this website, hopefully I can add some nice features over time and keep you posted on them.
-   Exploring JavaScript (e.g. node.js)
    > I've written a couple of things in JavaScript, either LWC or standalone node.js applications. I'd like to further explore this path, maybe mixing in some TypeScript (SFDX plugin anyone?).
-   Salesforce Certified Technical Architect (CTA) topics
    > I'm coaching other people to become a CTA. Would be good to share some of the coaching sessions, ideas or materials.
-   Hopefully some fun projects with my kids using electronics
    > I've been looking into things like Arduino recently, mainly smart home applications. Happy to share my thoughts about those things here as well.
